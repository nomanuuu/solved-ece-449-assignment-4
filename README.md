 <li> A fuzzy system is used to control the temperature in a room. The inputs to the controller are the ‘Temperature’ and ‘Temperature change’. The outputs are the ‘Fan Speed’ and ‘Heater power’. The membership functions are shown in the following figures</li>

</ol>

and the rule base is described by the following table

<table width="444">

 <tbody>

  <tr>

   <td width="84"> </td>

   <td width="126"><strong>LOW </strong></td>

   <td width="117"><strong>MEDIUM </strong></td>

   <td width="117"><strong>HIGH </strong></td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="84"><strong>NEG </strong></td>

   <td width="126">LOW/ON</td>

   <td width="117">ON/LOW</td>

   <td width="117">MEDIUM/ON</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="84"><strong>ZERO </strong></td>

   <td width="126">LOW/ON</td>

   <td width="117">LOW/OFF</td>

   <td width="117">MEDIUM/OFF</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>

   <td width="84"><strong>POS </strong></td>

   <td width="126">LOW/OFF</td>

   <td width="117">MEDIUM/OFF</td>

   <td width="117">HIGH/OFF</td>

  </tr>

 </tbody>

</table>




If the temperature is 22° C and the change of temperature is 4° C/hr, answer the following questions: a) What is the result of fuzzification of those inputs?

<ol>

 <li>Use the rules and Mamdani inference to specify the output fuzzy membership functions.</li>

 <li>Calculate the ‘Heater power’ and ‘Fan speed’ using your choice of defuzzification method.</li>

</ol>
